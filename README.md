This repository contains an example of an uncommon error in JavaScript related to null value handling in arithmetic operations.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The error arises from not explicitly handling null values before performing arithmetic, which can lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., type errors or incorrect results). The solution demonstrates proper null checking before any operations are carried out.
